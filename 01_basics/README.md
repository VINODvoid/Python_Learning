# Inner Working of Python 



Python is an interpreted language. When you run a python script, the interpreter reads the code line by line and executes it. The interpreter is the program that reads and executes the code you write. It is the program that converts the code you write into machine code that the computer can understand.

``` python
example.py
print("Hello, World!")
```



### 2. Python Bytecode
When you run a python script, the interpreter converts the code into an intermediate form called bytecode. Bytecode is a low-level representation of the code that can be executed by the Python interpreter. The bytecode is stored in a file with a `.pyc` extension.

### 3. Python Virtual Machine
The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is the program that executes the bytecode generated by the Python interpreter. The PVM is responsible for running the code you write and producing the output.

### 4. Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects. The GIL prevents multiple threads from executing Python code at the same time. This means that only one thread can execute Python code at a time, even on multi-core processors.
